# Portfolio Chart Debug Information

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Current Value Calculation**: 
   - Previous: Calculated per-investment instead of cumulative portfolio value
   - Fixed: Now calculates total portfolio value across all investments up to each date

2. **Data Filling Logic**:
   - Previous: Filled missing dates with static values that didn't update with current prices
   - Fixed: Recalculates current values for each date based on current market prices

3. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Current Value line is now green (#10b981) with thicker stroke (strokeWidth=3)
   - Better contrast against the gray investment area

## Debug Information Added:
- Console logging of chart data for troubleshooting
- Shows number of investments, available prices, and sample data

## To Test:
1. Check browser console for "Chart Debug Info" logs
2. Verify Current Value line shows cumulative portfolio value (not individual item values)
3. Check that manual price updates refresh the chart correctly

## Expected Behavior:
- Investment line (gray area) should show cumulative investment amounts over time
- Current Value line (green) should show what the portfolio is worth at current market prices
- Lines should diverge showing profit/loss based on price changes
